[Help] Can't get sag mill powered.First off,if there any reason this wouldn't work? I'm running the new 1.0.3 direwolf20 pack on a fresh server.This is even the first machine that has been built on this server.Just power an alloy smelter with a stirling generator (they're crazy cheap and will transmit) and make some conduit.level 2.SAG Mill power draw models are used in mill design and grinding circuit modelling to predict how much power will be consumed by a particular mill geometry and operating configuration.This paper will compare SAG mill models by Morrell,Loveday (using &quot;Power Numbers&quot; published by Barratt) and Austin against several published mill surveys.Benchmarking: SAG Mill Power Draw ModelsBenchmarking: SAG Mill Power Draw Meadowbank.Muteb,P.&amp; Allaire,J.Meadowbank Mine Process Plant Throughput Increase,Proceedings of the Canadian Mineral Processors Annual General Meeting,Ottawa,Canada,January 2013.Power reported &quot;at the DCS&quot;.DCS Power,kW Ball Mill fillingSagmilling.com is home to a collection of both free and subscription based calculation tools to aid metallurgical process engineers perform comminution calculations.Grinding circuit design tools,including for SAG mill ball mill circuits,and geometallurgy energy models are available to subscribers.

## New &amp; Used Sag Mills for Sale Semi Autogenous Grinding.
A SAG mill is generally used as a primary or first stage grinding solution.Attrition between grinding balls and ore particles causes grinding of finer particles.SAG mills are characterized by their large diameter and short length as compared to ball mills.SAG mills are primarily used at gold,copper and platinum mines with applications also.The design of the foot diameter SAG mill installed at the Cadia Gold Mine,New South Wales Australia,followed after two years of extensive.SAG mill base power was estimated from pilot.GROSS POWER CALCULATORpredicted.Slurry pooling causes the power draw in AG and SAG mills to be lower than a mill without a slurry pool.This phenomenon results in overflow mills usually drawing less power than grate discharge mills that are operating without a slurry pool.This is because by definition overflow mills operate all of the time with a slurry pool.&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The mills at Sentinel in Zambia are amongst the world’s biggest,with 2 off 40 ft SAG mills complete with 28 MW drives,and 2 off 28 foot ball mills with 22 …
