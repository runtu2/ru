## Mill (grinding)
Mill (grinding) [ ]A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.horse mill),wind or water ().Hammer Mill Operating Principle.We have never subscribed to the idea that the hammermill is suited to the primary breaking of shovel loaded,quarry run,or ROM mine run rock and ore.Even though the material be non abrasive and quite friable there are other machines which are better fitted for such work.(PDF) DESIGN AND EVALUATE OF A SMALL HAMMER MILL tarek.(PDF) DESIGN AND EVALUATE OF A SMALL HAMMER MILL tarek.[ ]Hammer mills have wide applicability in biomass size reduction because of their simple design,ruggedness,and versatility.According to Scholten and McEllhiney,(1985) mentioned that hammer mills have achieved merit because of their ability to finely grind a …Direct mechanical energy measures of hammer mill Biomass.measurement was calculated as &#177;0.072 MJ Mg.Particle size distributions created by hammer mill were.Rosin Rammler equation fitted the size distribution Mechanical power input into the hammer mill was directly mon .

## Effect of Size Reduction Parameters in Pharmaceutical.
Effect of Size Reduction Parameters in Pharmaceutical.[ ]Both lactose granules and extruded lentils were used to determine the effect of size reduction parameters in the pharmaceutical milling process.The 10kg of extruded lentils (extrudate) used in the study were pulled from line production at the completion of hot melt extrusion.Within hammer mills are noisy and can generate dust pollution.General Design The major components of these hammermills,shown in the picture,include: a delivery device is used to introduce the material to be ground into the path of the hammers.A rotor comprised of a series of machined disks mounted on the horizontal shaft performs this task.
