## Sedimentary rocks
Sedimentary rocks.Sedimentary rocks are the product of the erosion of existing rocks.Eroded material accumulates as sediment,either in the sea or on land,and is then buried,compacted and cemented to produce sedimentary rock (a process known as diagenesis).There are two major groupings of sedimentary rocks: Clastic sedimentary rocks…rocks are broadly known as clastic rocks because they consist of distinct particles or clasts.Clastic petrology is concerned with classification,particularly with respect to the mineral composition of fragments or particles,as well as the shapes of particles (angular versus rounded),and the degree of homogeneity of particle sizes.Caterham 620S vs Go Kart [feat.Jamie Chadwick]&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;I take the Caterham 620S to Whilton Mill Kart track and race Jamie Chadwick in her go kart.Caterham 620S vs Go Kart [feat.Jamie Chadwick] Seen Through Glass.Define clastic rock.clastic rock synonyms,clastic rock pronunciation,clastic rock translation,English dictionary definition of clastic rock.Noun 1.clastic rock a rock composed of broken pieces of older rocks geology a science that deals with the history of the earth as recorded in rocks.
